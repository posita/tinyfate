Ugh, apparently I have left this neglected for far too long.

So, I used this repo back in 2016 to teach myself enough sphinx to post the then-current version of TinyFate to an S3 bucket, and then I kind of forgot about it.  I'm rectifying that now, and as part of that I really need to do a more coherent README, but honestly it's SUPER late and I need some sleep, so hopefully I'll get around to it sooner or later. :)
