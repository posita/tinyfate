**THIS IS A DRAFT. IT'S STILL A LIVING DOCUMENT BEING DEVELOPED IN THE OPEN**

TinyFate is a very small version of the Fate roleplaying game. Find out more at www.faterpg.com. Familiarity with other RPGs will be necessary if you intend to run the game, but, if you just wish to play, then all the rules you need are here.

For the Fate Nerds
==================
If you’re new to Fate, I’d suggest skipping ahead to the next section. If you’re familiar with Fate in any of its many forms, this may seem like a weird document.  It’s not merely a minimalist presentation of Fate, rather it’s an attempt to talk about the game a little bit differently. Most noticeable, I’m trying to make the language a little bit closer to boardgame instructions, focusing on procedure. To that end, I avoid Fate terminology in a few places where you might expect it. I do not yet know if this is a good or bad thing, but I look forward to finding out.


Getting Started
===============
A TinyFate game should have three to five people, one of whom will be the Game Master (or GM) and the rest of which will be players. Play will be around a single table, where both the GM and the players can see everything in play. If your group wants to play online or with more or fewer players, then feel free, but the default assumption is three to five, around a table.
Supplies
The game will need the following supplies:

* A pencil for each person, and at least one dark marker or pen
* A stack of index cards (and something to keep them in)
* One set of four Fate dice per person
* A small container holding ~50  tokens, like poker chips or glass beads (Nothing edible!). This is colloquially referred to as “The Bowl.”

Most of these items can be found anywhere, but the dice will probably require a trip to a game store or a visit to http://www.evilhat.com/home/fate-dice/.
