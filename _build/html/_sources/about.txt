About this game
***************

The original version of TinyFate was written to my blog at http://walkingmind.evilhat.com, and is expanded here. The inspiration to write it up more fully was born out out a fantastic post at the Step into RPGs blog (https://stepintorpgs.wordpress.com).

This game was developed largely in the open, on my blog  and on google docs, and has been vastly improved by feedback from  many people, including:
Stephen Morphlew
Michael McCully
Bruno Bord
Jim Dagg
Kirby Gehman
Dan Kaiser
Jonathan Hobbs
Michael McCully
Nicolas Gilardi
Sean Dunstan
Terence Leong
Robert Wiesehan
Timo L

Purpose
========
I describe this as an experiment for a number of reasons. The largest is that the very first draft of TinyFate fit on a pair of index cards, and that was genuinely all I felt I needed to make it work. This version is much longer because it's been an exercise in unpacking **all** of my assumptions. Turns out there are a lot of them.  It also has been an opportunity to try a variety of publishing technologies. This iteration used sphinx (http://docs.writethedocs.org/tools/sphinx/), which I find pretty neat, and which I think may be useful for some future collaboration.  


License and Stuff
=================
This is still a work in progress, but the expectation is that this will be released under Fate Compatible licenses once it's complete. In the interim, I have been using it to experiment with various publishing tools and techniques, most currently building with sphinx via github (repo at https://github.com/rdonoghue/tinyfate)
