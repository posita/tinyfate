<h1>Outside of Conflict</h1>
<p>Aspects may also come up outside of conflicts - players and the GM may refer to them when describing what happens. For example, a character with the “Army Brat” aspect might know things about military lifestyle that other characters don’t. This sort of use of aspects should be fairly common.
In a borderline case, a player may spend a fate point (to the bowl) to assert that their aspect is usefully applicable, and the GM should roll with that.</p>
<div class="section" id="making-an-offer-outside-of-a-conflict">
<h2>Making an Offer Outside of a Conflict</h2>
<p>If a situation comes up where a player’s aspect might cause trouble, the GM may offer the player a fate point from the bowl. If they accept, then the aspect is the source of trouble. If they refuse, then the GM keeps moving, and goes to some other sort of trouble.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ending-the-game">
<h2>Ending the Game</h2>
<p>At the end of the game, players have the option of changing one of their aspects to reflect events in play. Game end will also initiate another round of cleanup, where any aspects that shouldn’t persist into the next game are removed (including from the status card).</p>
