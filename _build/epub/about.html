<h1>About this game</h1>
<p>The original version of TinyFate was written to my blog at <a class="reference external" href="http://walkingmind.evilhat.com">http://walkingmind.evilhat.com</a>, and is expanded here. The inspiration to write it up more fully was born out out a fantastic post at the Step into RPGs blog (<a class="reference external" href="https://stepintorpgs.wordpress.com">https://stepintorpgs.wordpress.com</a>).</p>
<p>This game was developed largely in the open, on my blog  and on google docs, and has been vastly improved by feedback from  many people, including:
Stephen Morphlew
Michael McCully
Bruno Bord
Jim Dagg
Kirby Gehman
Dan Kaiser
Jonathan Hobbs
Michael McCully
Nicolas Gilardi
Sean Dunstan
Terence Leong
Robert Wiesehan
Timo L</p>

<div class="section" id="purpose">
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>I describe this as an experiment for a number of reasons. The largest is that the very first draft of TinyFate fit on a pair of index cards, and that was genuinely all I felt I needed to make it work. This version is much longer because it&#8217;s been an exercise in unpacking <strong>all</strong> of my assumptions. Turns out there are a lot of them.  It also has been an opportunity to try a variety of publishing technologies. This iteration used sphinx (<a class="reference external" href="http://docs.writethedocs.org/tools/sphinx/">http://docs.writethedocs.org/tools/sphinx/</a>), which I find pretty neat, and which I think may be useful for some future collaboration.</p>

<h2>License and Stuff</h2>
<p>This is still a work in progress, but the expectation is that this will be released under Fate Compatible licenses once it&#8217;s complete. In the interim, I have been using it to experiment with various publishing tools and techniques, most currently building with sphinx via github (repo at <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/rdonoghue/tinyfate">https://github.com/rdonoghue/tinyfate</a>)</p>
