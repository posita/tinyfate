<h1>About this game</h1>
<p>The original version of TinyFate was written to my blog at <a class="reference external" href="http://walkingmind.evilhat.com">http://walkingmind.evilhat.com</a>, and is expanded here. The inspiration to write it up more fully was born out out a fantastic post at the Step into RPGs blog (<a class="reference external" href="https://stepintorpgs.wordpress.com">https://stepintorpgs.wordpress.com</a>).</p>
<p>This game was developed largely in the open, on my blog  and on google docs, and has been vastly improved by feedback from  many people, including:</p>

<div class="section" id="purpose">
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>I describe this as an experiment for a number of reasons. The largest is that the very first draft of TinyFate fit on a pair of index cards, and that was genuinely all I felt I needed to make it work. This version is much longer because it’s been an exercise in unpacking <strong>all</strong> of my assumptions. Turns out there are a lot of them.  It also has been an opportunity to try a variety of publishing technologies. This iteration used sphinx (<a class="reference external" href="http://docs.writethedocs.org/tools/sphinx/">http://docs.writethedocs.org/tools/sphinx/</a>), which I find pretty neat, and which I think may be useful for some future collaboration.</p>

<h2>License and Stuff</h2>
<p>This is still a work in progress, but the expectation is that this will be released under Fate Compatible licenses once it’s complete. In the interim, I have been using it to experiment with various publishing tools and techniques, most currently building with sphinx via github (repo at <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/rdonoghue/tinyfate">https://github.com/rdonoghue/tinyfate</a>)</p>
<p>0.5.0</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="version-notes">
<h2>Version Notes</h2>
<p>0.5.0 Unpacked a lot of detail around conflict resolution and brought in all my various out of sync text files.  I’m a little worried that the flow is now a little screwed up, but I’m unifying on a canonical version so I can actually fix it rather than just let it sit idle.</p>
<p>0.4.03  Less about substantive changes and more about me remembering how to use Sphinx.</p>
<p>Earlier versions - Did not occur to me to track them. Oops.</p>
