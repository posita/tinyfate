<h1>Advanced Rules</h1>
<p>Advanced rules are optional rules for use with TinyFate. They may be freely used or ignored, but everyone in the game should be in agreement about their status.</p>
<div class="section" id="advanced-rules-big-effects">
<h2>Advanced Rules: Big Effects</h2>
<p>The GM may determine that certain outcomes may require one or more aspects be in place first. For example, no roll is going to let a character punch down a stone wall, so the GM may require some number of aspects (usually 1–3) to “set up” the final effect.
This rule can also be applied to killing targets (or players). It may require some number of injuries or inconveniences before “dead” is a viable outcome.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="advanced-rules-gm-veto-and-player-offers">
<h2>Advanced Rules: GM Veto and Player Offers</h2>
<p>By default, the GM is the one responsible for calling out when things have gone off the rails, like a player declaring that their successful lockpick roll means they’ve punched out the dragon. This is a responsibility, not an authority. In fact, everyone at the table has the same right to object when things drift too far from reasonable.
Once players are comfortable with that responsibility, they should also consider that they can Offer a Bargain to one another when the situation calls for it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="advanced-rules-locations">
<h2>Advanced Rules: Locations</h2>
<p>If a scene takes place somewhere large or complicated, then the GM can lay down aspects to reflect different zones of the location (she can even lay them down in a simple map). Which location a character is in provides useful information about what they can do, and can be part of the difficulty. For example, if you try to attack someone with your sword and they’re in another location, then that location probably gets folded into the difficulty (to reflect the distance you need to close).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="advance-rules-offering-a-question">
<h2>Advance Rules: Offering a Question</h2>
<p>At any point, the GM may ask a player a question about the game, specifically a question of something beyond the immediate scope of their actions. This may range from some bit of backstory to a theory about what an NPC is up to. The player may defer, but if they answer, the GM will give them one fate point from the bowl. What the GM does with the answer is up to the GM, though it most often will be incorporated into the game as presented.</p>
